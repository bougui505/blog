# Interactive svg with inkscape

Just open the object properties for a given object in inkscape with a right
click or (`Shift+Ctrl+O`) and unfold the interactivity section:

In this example, when you will open the svg file in a web browser, the object
will appear when moving the mouse pointer onto an image. It will disappear when
you move out the pointer.
