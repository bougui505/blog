# iPython 2.3.0-2 cannot save or autosave over mounted directory via sshfs

A workaround for this bug is to add this options to the file `/etc/auto.sshfs`:

    workaround=rename,noexec

The full line of my `/etc/auto.sshfs` is:

    home_pro -fstype=fuse,port=22,rw,allow_other,workaround=rename,noexec :sshfs\#username@hostname\:/path/to/the/directory/to/mount
