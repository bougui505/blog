	abstract = {Motivation: Scoring functions provided by the docking software are still a major limiting factor in virtual screening ({VS}) process to classify compounds. Score analysis of the docking is not able to find out all active compounds. This is due to a bad estimation of the ligand binding energies. Making the assumption that active compounds should have specific contacts with their target to display activity, it would be possible to discriminate active compounds from inactive ones with careful analysis of interatomic contacts between the molecule and the target. However, compounds clustering is very tedious due to the large number of contacts extracted from the different conformations proposed by docking experiments.
Results: Structural analysis of docked structures is processed in three steps: (i) a Kohonen self-organizing map ({SOM}) training phase using drug–protein contact descriptors followed by (ii) an unsupervised cluster analysis and (iii) a Newick file generation for results visualization as a tree. The docking poses are then analysed and classified quickly and automatically by {AuPosSOM} (Automatic analysis of Poses using {SOM}). {AuPosSOM} can be integrated into strategies for {VS} currently employed. We demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate active compounds from inactive ones using only mean protein contacts' footprints calculation from the multiple conformations given by the docking software. Chemical structure of the compound and key binding residues information are not necessary to find out active molecules. Thus, contact–activity relationship can be employed as a new {VS} process.

	abstract = {Prion protein is a strongly conserved and ubiquitous glycoprotein. The conformational conversion of the non-pathogenic cellular prion isoform ({PrPC}) into a pathogenic scrapie isoform ({PrPSc}) is a fundamental event in the onset of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ({TSE}). During this conversion, helix H1 and its two flanking loops are known to undergo a conformational transition into a β-like structure. In order to understand mechanisms which trigger this transconformation, sheep prion protein synthetic peptides spanning helix 1 and β-strand 2 (residues 142–166) were studied: (1) the N3 peptide, studied earlier, is known to fold into β-hairpin-like conformation in phosphate buffer at neutral {pH} and to adopt a helix H1 conformation when dissolved in trifluoroethanol/phosphate buffer mixture, (2) The R156A mutant (peptide R15) and (3) the Y155A mutant (peptide Y14) of the N3 peptide are studied by circular dichroism and {NMR} spectroscopy in this article. Structural characterization of these peptides highlights the key role of tyrosine 155 in the stabilization of the β-hairpin-like conformation of the sheep peptide in phosphate buffer. We propose a model where tyrosine 155 could stabilize the β-hairpin structure by creating a hydrophobic core in phosphate buffer, necessary to initiate the β-type structure formation. In the turn, the side chain ionic interaction, E152-R156 described before, seems to play a minor role relative to the hydrophobic packing, as observed with the R156A mutation (peptide R15). Interestingly, homology at amino acid residue 155 could be responsible for the species barrier in {TSE}.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of docking results is one of the most important problems for virtual screening and in silico drug design. Modern approaches for the identification of active compounds in a large data set of docked molecules use energy scoring functions. One of the general and most significant limitations of these methods relates to inaccurate binding energy estimation, which results in false scoring of docked compounds. Automatic analysis of poses using self-organizing maps ({AuPosSOM}) represents an alternative approach for the evaluation of docking results based on the clustering of compounds by the similarity of their contacts with the receptor. A scoring function was developed for the identification of the active compounds in the {AuPosSOM} clustered dataset. In addition, the {AuPosSOM} efficiency for the clustering of compounds and the identification of key contacts considered as important for its activity, were also improved. Benchmark tests for several targets revealed that together with the developed scoring function, {AuPosSOM} represents a good alternative to the energy-based scoring functions for the evaluation of docking results.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Sampling the conformational space of biological macromolecules generates large sets of data with considerable complexity. Data-mining techniques, such as clustering, can extract meaningful information. Among them, the Self-Organizing Maps ({SOMs}) algorithm has shown great promise, in particular since its computation time rises only linearly with the size of the data set. Whereas {SOMs} are generally used with few neurons, we investigate here their behavior with large numbers of neurons.
Results: We present here a python library implementing the full {SOM} analysis workflow. Large {SOMs} can readily be applied on heavy data sets. Coupled with visualization tools they have very interesting properties. Descriptors for each conformation of a trajectory are calculated and mapped onto a 3D landscape, the U-matrix, reporting the distance between neighboring neurons. To delineate clusters, we developed the flooding algorithm, which hierarchically identifies local basins of the U-matrix from the global minimum to the maximum.
Availability: The python implementation of the {SOM} library is freely available on github: https://github.com/bougui505/{SOM}.
